Machinon issue and contributing Guidelines
==========================================

### Issue Guidelines

Before opening a new issue, please review the following:
* The Github Issues is for Domoticz CODE Bugs only. Please do not use this for general questions, howto, or this is not working conversations. If you have a question, please post to our forum at https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=24084
* Please use the search feature to see if your issues have been raised or addressed first.
* First try to update to the latest beta version.
* Always state your version when reporting code related issues
* Often we will require Log Files and Screenshots to help diagnose the issue. 

### Contributing to Machinon

Please base your bug fixes against the beta branch. The master branch is considered the stable and is used for our releases. 
All changes should be based against the beta branch, unless advised by a Maintainer to use a different branch.
